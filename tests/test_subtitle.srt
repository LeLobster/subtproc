00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,604

- Very nice.

7
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,937
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,648
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,483
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,367

- That's all right.

11
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,741

12
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,998

- Very nice.

13
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,997
- Shall we go through?

14
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,623
Thank you, Miss Turner.

15
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,919
This way.

16
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,004

24
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,170
How long have I got?

26
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,555
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

27
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,009
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

28
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,311
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

29
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,060
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

30
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,767
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

31
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,022
Oh, wait.

32
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,859
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

33
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,098
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Hello.

34
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,391
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hi, squirt. What are you doing?

35
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,980
<i>Playing.</i>

36
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,611
Where's Mummy?

37
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,321
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

38
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,032

39
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,657

<i>- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

40
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,622
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

41
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,287
i am sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

42
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,872
<i>Why not?</i>

43
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,629
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

44
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,507
Very sorry about it, but i just can't. Don't i?

45
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,674
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

46
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,218
<i>All right.</i>

47
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,553
- Anything special that you want?
<i>- Yes.</i>

48
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,850
What?

49
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,644
<i>A telephone.</i>

50
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,351
We've got Iots of telephones already.

51
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,024
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday?

52
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,901
Something very special?

53
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,565
<i>- Yes.</i>
- What?

54
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,025
<i>A bush baby.</i>

55
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,737
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

56
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,911
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

57
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,869
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Tell Mummy that i teIephoned. Okay?

58
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,328
And that I'II try
to telephone again tomorrow.

59
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,500
Now, will you tell her that?

60
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,502
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,339
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

62
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,631
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,889
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

64
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,720
<i>All right.</i>

65
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,510
Okay. Now, take care
and be a good girl, won't you?

66
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,977
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

67
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,643
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

68
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:43,783
- Elena, how nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a wonderful surprise.

69
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,831
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

70
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,045
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

71
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,541
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do?

72
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,417
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

73
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,719
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

74
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,384
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

75
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,132
Do sit down.

76
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,509
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

77
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,394
Thank you.

78
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,435
- Would you like a drink, doctor?
- No, thank you.

79
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,109
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

80
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,779
I'll just sit with you a minute.
Then I'll be off.

81
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,448
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

82
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,993
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

83
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,535
He's been doing some
underwater research in the Baltic...

84
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,830
...so I'm afraid we don't get to see
very much of each other these days.

85
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,671
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

86
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,883
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

87
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,130
We're going home.

88
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:41,216
We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

89
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,139
- What about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

90
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,681
Oh, are you?

91
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,647
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

92
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,981
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

93
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,901
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

94
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,868
It's that for the past two weeks...

95
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,494
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

96
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,833
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

97
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,417
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

98
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,797
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

99
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,804
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.
